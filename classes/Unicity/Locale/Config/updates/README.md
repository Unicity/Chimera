## What is this folder about?
Since we need to have a .sqlite DB with all the countries, currencies, and states for each country, and we can't really see the changes across commits on this database,
along with the changes in the `.sqlite` file, we're also be adding the changes made on every ticket, separated by folder.
The idea is, somewhere in the future, automate the process of creating the `.sqlite` file and populate it with all the data on the building process
